# Personas for TeamAssist

## Rachel - the Dojo Admin
Rachel is tasked not only with affirming Dojo engagement scheduling but also making sure coaches and teams are well aware of assignments well in advance. Additionally, she also is looped in, if not downright responsible, regarding potential teams -- Taking inquiries, scheduling consults, pitching the coaching model, responding on avaiability, closing the deal and providing reports. We assume her enterprise has Dojos in multiple locations, and while she is coordinating with the other Dojo Admins, the bulk of her concern is the smooth operation of her own.

### Rachel's current pain
She is using sharepoint to host an excel file of team contacts. Others that gather leads give her info on the new ones and she has to add those records as well. She maintains a status field with 7-8 values and continuously sorts on it. Teams ready for consults and charters with coaches require more folow up and meetings to schedule in Outlook. Although this serves the front end of the Dojo, no one else is helping to maintain this data, so she passes on recording anything once the team is in for the 6 weeks. People begin to expect more from the data, and ask about what we are measuring for the teams. She rather have the coaches handle that, but all attempts in that area produce gaps that lead non-useful information when it comes time to follow up.

She kinda resents that she records all this information and few find it worth reading. Instead, she is constantly pinged and feeling the need to remind her team of their commitments.

### Rachel's desired outcomes
- A fast interface that controls who can see what, available to her team in the enterprise with helpful visibility tools
- A scheduling tool that she can own, but others can help keep up to date.
	- It should show blocks of weeks, as that is the natural unit of measure for engagements
	- It should show 1-2 coaches assigned for Dojo engagements
	- It should show commitment level by color to know what is in pencil vs fully committed
	- It should show consults and other meetings BY TEAM that the coaching team needs to attend or facilitate
- A pipeline of teams and where they fit on the coaching value stream, enabling her and all in the coaching community to remain up to date with status continually, through graduation and follow up
- Ability to provide reports to leadership based on custom queries

### App's current delivery for Rachel
The features of all desired outcomes are complete, except for specialized reporting, which is in the backlog.

## Randy - Manager (or PO) of the Dojos
Randy is on the hook for making the multi-site Dojo a success. This includes the brand, the ROI, the marketing, sales, recruiting, training and well being of the team. He is very aware of the pipeliine, wants it to be full, or fuller, and wants to have the right level of coaching utilization over expected growth quarter by quarter.

### Randy's current pain
Randy has trouble making sense of the sheets being updated by Rachel and the two other site admins. The uncertianty of the teams entertaining a coaching engagement is hard to gauge and take action on, leading to uncertainty regarding staffing, scheduling, and cost control. 

### Randy's desired outcomes
- A visible pipeline, both globally as well as by location, with CRM essentials (notes, last contact, next contact) enabling him to be able to methodically attend to the sales process internally
- A way to see how current teams are doing based on coaches notes, health checks, and possible weekly reports
- A quick way to see the state of coaching utilization over a course of weeks as well as venue capacity utilization
- The ability to track progress of Dojo overall to help form the narrative in favor of the multi-facted ROI from investing in organizational learning
- A way to quickly identify an area of Dojo measurement, have it added to the application for coaches to track at the appropriate stages of the dojo

### App's current delivery for Randy
Randy is able to meet weekly with all 3 site admins and talk sales in a meaningful way, having all leads in front of each person, either filtered by sites(s) or global to all. Schedules also showing similarly, he can assess coaching availability quicky by weeks as well as project staffing needs. 
Also, answering to any escalations with teams, an easy reference to coaching notes and weekly reports gives him the context he needs to be up to speed and communicate responses to his coaching staff in writing.

## Jessie - Dojo coach
Jessie already has to work with Jira on internal stories around general coaching enablement, but wants a better way to handle teams on the coached team level. Jessie may not care much for using any tool for updating team status, but the questions for updating others are already to the point to where some helpful repository would make her life better. 

### Jessie's current pain
Jessie has to hand in a weekly report via email, and edits for conciseness are commonly requested. Looking up a report from prior weeks makes writing it easier, but that requires some odd sent forlder searching, making the process awkward. In addition, other information that should easily be common knowledge throughout the coaching team lives in a few places, and most coaches simply revert to ad-hoc inquiry, which breaks Jessies focus.

### Jessie's desired outcomes
- A shared coaching schedule filtered to her local dojo, where she can see and negotite her schedule with Rachael and the other coaches
- A single, fast loading location to update information about her current team in a way that is visible to the right people.
- Having a VSM tool for healing teams track their product flow would be a big step ahead of sheets and Visio that no one wants to update

### App's current delivery to Jessie
- Scheduling of dojo engagements for the local Dojo 
- Current team features like: VSM, weekly reports, coaching notes and health fields, plus configurable measures to record team maturity
