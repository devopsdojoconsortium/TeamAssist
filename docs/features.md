# Feature Screenshots

These screen collections use a sample re-brand, promoting local customization. A demo application is in the works.


## Current Teams list
Teams/Engagements are divided into: 
- Current
- Potential (CRM Opportunities)
- Completed

Each has a configurable set of sub-statii, allowing focus on what matters in your timeline, and for your value stream.

    - Coaches assigned to team  (optional)
    - Team members assigned to team (optional)

1. Coaching Schedule in week blocks by team
     - Assign 1-2 coaches to a team for a 6+ week Dojo engagement
     - Schedule Charters, Consults and more alongside coaching assignments to track transformation team availability, making visible to all.
1. VSM tool for any team
     - By team engagement, create 1-n Value Streams in a clean interface, negating the need for Visio and spreadsheets that require followup work.
     - VSM is easily mutable so the team can track progress, keep the value stream visible, and own their own Kaizen.
     - VSM events never go away, so progress can literally be replayed in the UI. Treat each change like a git commit and consume change history as needed.
     - Track actual numbers for lead and process time progress for future reports of success.
1. Active Team coaching notes and formal weekly reporting
    - Coaching journal notes for ongoing - adhoc note taking with markdown
    - Weekly reports designed for Dojo challenges, but valuable for any multi-week engagement.
    - Configurable for additional team maturity progress measures the enterprise needs to track, including DevOps Radar, Agility Health, etc.
